# About Project
### A small project showcasing ways to write unit and e2e tests for your react UI components.
- We will be developing some react components that will use react's popular hooks, like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useContext`, and will be writing **unit test cases for them using jest + react-testing-library([check docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/))**.
- We will be developing **E2E test cases for some workflow using Cypress([check docs](https://www.cypress.io/))**.
- We will use [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw) to intercept API calls as we are not creating networks here.
- We will use [react-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query), just for fun ðŸ™‚.
- We will see how we can architect this test-based project.
